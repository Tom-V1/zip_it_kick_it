Zip_it_kick_it 

A little python script to automate the compressing of files in a location after a certain number of days. 

Simply run config_app.exe and select the target and archive location then choose the age of the files in days you would like to be achieved. 

Then run zip_it_kick_it.exe either manually or through an automating tool such as System Scheduler.
